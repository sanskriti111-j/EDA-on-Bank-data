**Key Insights**
Deposits and Savings Behavior
A strong positive correlation exists between Bank Deposits and Savings Accounts.

This suggests overlapping financial behavior â€” customers who actively deposit funds also tend to maintain or grow their savings.

Income, Age, and Accumulation
Estimated Income and Age show moderate correlations with:

Superannuation

Checking and Savings Balances

This reflects a typical financial lifecycle: older and higher-income individuals accumulate more financial assets and may carry higher loans or credit card balances.

Low Correlation with Property Ownership
Properties Owned has low correlation with most banking variables.

Indicates external factors like real estate markets, inheritance, or regional pricing are more influential than day-to-day banking activity.

Business vs. Personal Banking
Business Lending has a moderate correlation with Bank Loans, suggesting overlap for customers with both personal and business obligations.

However, business lending is largely uncorrelated with savings or deposits, indicating it's a distinct financial domain in customer behavior.
